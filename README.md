### What is this repository for? ###

* The java game is put in the src file.

* The WelcomeHelp.java is the welcome page of our game. 
* The Gamepage.java is the game GUI of our game. When the user chooses a level in the welcomeHelp page, it directs to the gamepage.

* There are three levels in this game. The first level is the same as the original game. We added additional features in the second and third level (see descriptions). The second level is functional, but we are still developing the third level.
